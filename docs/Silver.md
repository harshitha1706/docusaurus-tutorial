## Silver layer (cleansed and conformed data)

In the Silver layer of the lakehouse, the data from the Bronze layer is matched, merged, conformed and cleansed ("just-enough") so that the Silver layer can provide an "Enterprise view" of all its key business entities, concepts and transactions. (e.g. master customers, stores, non-duplicated transactions and cross-reference tables).

The Silver layer brings the data from different sources into an Enterprise view and enables self-service analytics for ad-hoc reporting, advanced analytics and ML. It serves as a source for Departmental Analysts, Data Engineers and Data Scientists to further create projects and analysis to answer business problems via enterprise and departmental data projects in the Gold Layer.

In the lakehouse data engineering paradigm, typically the ELT methodology is followed vs. ETL - which means only minimal or "just-enough" transformations and data cleansing rules are applied while loading the Silver layer. Speed and agility to ingest and deliver the data in the data lake is prioritized, and a lot of project-specific complex transformations and business rules are applied while loading the data from the Silver to Gold layer. From a data modeling perspective, the Silver Layer has more 3rd-Normal Form like data models. Data Vault-like, write-performant data models can be used in this layer.
