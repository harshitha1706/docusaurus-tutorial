## Gold layer (curated business-level tables)

Data in the Gold layer of the lakehouse is typically organized in consumption-ready "project-specific" databases. The Gold layer is for reporting and uses more de-normalized and read-optimized data models with fewer joins. The final layer of data transformations and data quality rules are applied here. Final presentation layer of projects such as Customer Analytics, Product Quality Analytics, Inventory Analytics, Customer Segmentation, Product Recommendations, Marking/Sales Analytics etc. fit in this layer. We see a lot of Kimball style star schema-based data models or Inmon style Data marts fit in this Gold Layer of the lakehouse.

So you can see that the data is curated as it moves through the different layers of a lakehouse. In some cases, we also see that lot of Data Marts and EDWs from the traditional RDBMS technology stack are ingested into the lakehouse, so that for the first time Enterprises can do "pan-EDW" advanced analytics and ML - which was just not possible or too cost prohibitive to do on a traditional stack. (e.g. IoT/Manufacturing data is tied with Sales and Marketing data for defect analysis or health care genomics, EMR/HL7 clinical data markets are tied with financial claims data to create a Healthcare Data Lake for timely and improved patient care analytics.)
