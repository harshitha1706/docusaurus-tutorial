## Technologies to Learn for Databricks
To work with Databricks, you should have knowledge of:
1.	Big Data & Distributed Computing
-	Apache Spark (Core engine used by Databricks)
-	Hadoop (Optional, but useful for understanding data lakes)

2.	Programming Languages
-	Python (PySpark)
-	SQL (For querying structured data)
-	Scala (For advanced Spark development)

3.	Cloud Platforms (Since Databricks runs on the cloud)
-	Azure (Azure Databricks)
-	AWS (Databricks on AWS)
-	Google Cloud (Databricks on GCP)

4.	Data Engineering & ETL
-	Delta Lake (Databricks' optimized data lake storage)
-	Data ingestion tools like Apache Kafka, Airflow

5.	Machine Learning & AI (If working with AI models)
-	MLflow (Used for managing ML models in Databricks)

## Real-Time Example:
Use Case: Fraud Detection in Banking
-	A bank processes millions of transactions daily.
-	They use Databricks to analyze real-time transaction data and identify fraudulent activities.
-	Steps: 
1.	Data is streamed into Databricks from transaction logs.
2.	Machine learning models (MLflow) analyze patterns.
3.	If a suspicious transaction is detected, an alert is triggered.
4.	The model keeps improving over time with more data.

## Where Databricks Fits in Project Development?
Databricks is used in the Data Engineering & AI/ML stages of a project.
It mainly appears in the following phases:
1.	Data Collection – Ingest data from sources (databases, APIs, Kafka).
2.	Data Processing & Transformation – Clean and format data for analysis.
3.	Data Analysis & Visualization – Use Spark SQL and notebooks for insights.
4.	Machine Learning & AI – Train models using MLflow.
5.	Deployment & Monitoring – Deploy models and monitor performance.

## Summary
-	Databricks = Cloud-based Apache Spark platform for Big Data & AI.
-	Learn: Spark, Python/SQL, Cloud (Azure/AWS/GCP), MLflow.
-	Real-world use case: Fraud detection, recommendation systems, ETL processing.
-	Project stage: Data processing, ML model training, and deployment.
